/*
This header file was generated when you ran setup. Once created, the setup
process won't overwrite it, so you can adjust the values by hand and
recompile if you need to.

To enable lots of debug output, add this line and re-run setup.py:
#define SYSV_IPC_DEBUG

To recreate this file, just delete it and re-run setup.py.

KEY_MIN, KEY_MAX and SEMAPHORE_VALUE_MAX are stored internally in longs, so
you should never #define them to anything larger than LONG_MAX regardless of
what your operating system is capable of.
